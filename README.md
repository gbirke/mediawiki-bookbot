# MediaWiki Bookbot
This MediaWiki Bot generates a print page from a table of contents with links to other pages.

## TODO
- Make print version name configurable
- Make dependency on FlaggedRevs extension optional
- Configuration option to use newest or stable version when FlaggedRevs is installed
- Better strategy to determine book name
- Describe book structure (with name spaces and TOC) in README
- Describe installation and usage in README
 

## Possible future improvements
- Fix headline indentation on print page to match the indentation in the table of contents.
- keep the table of contents in sync with the pages it's linking to.
